# Eluvio Core Software Engineering - Challenge

The program "script.py" is written in Python3 and it follows the following criteria: 
- Given a large number of binary files, the program finds the longest strand of bytes
  that is identical between two or more files. I will be using the test set in this 
  directory.
  
### The program displays the following outputs:
- The length of the strand
- The file names where the largest strand appears
- The offset where the strand appears in each file
