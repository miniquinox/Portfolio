# Portfolio

Hello guys! My name is Joaquin Carretero and I am a Computer Engineer 
    with background in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.

I will be posting and updating this repository with different projects 
    I have worked on over the past few years and some that I am currently
    working on.
    
There is a separate folder for each Engineering branch. Please do not share 
    the content of these programs/circuits/3D models because some of them 
    are currently under review for being patented.
    
I went to the University of New Mexico but I currently live in the San Franciso
    Bay Area, looking for full time Engineering positions and willing to 
    relocate anywhere i have applied.
