# Portfolio

Hi there! My name is Joaquin Carretero and I am a Computer Engineer 
    with background in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.

I will be posting and updating this repository with different projects 
    I have worked on over the past few years and some that I am currently
    working on.
    
There is a separate folder for each Engineering branch.
    
I graduated from the University of New Mexico but I currently live in the 
    San Franciso Bay Area, looking for full time Engineering positions and 
    willing to relocate.
